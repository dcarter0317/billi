Create a Bill and Budget Management - An app to help track and manage your budget or bill.
The apps should be able to:
- A page where you can add, delete, edit each item
- Each item should have the app balance
- Style each item in the list as a card

Card should have:
- A title(text field)
- Due date (date picker)
- Status (pay, paid)(toggle switch)
- Amount (Text field)
- Each card should be draggable so the users can reorder the list.

Use the following tech stack:
- React Native
- Expo
